## Functional Specs

This project runs a simple simulation of 1000 baseball games between the Cubs and the Sox.

The idea is to see how often each team would win if the Cubs had a slightly better chance (55%) than the Sox (45%).

The simulation just prints out how many games each team wins out of 1000.
